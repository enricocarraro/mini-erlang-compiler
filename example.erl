% Guards are constructs that we can use to increase the power of pattern
% matching. Using guards, we can perform simple tests and comparisons on the
% variables in a pattern.
% You can use guards in the heads of function definitions where they are
% introduced by the `when` keyword, or you can use them at any place in the
% language where an expression is allowed.

max(X, Y) -> Y.


% A guard is a series of guard expressions, separated by commas (`,`).
% The guard `GuardExpr1, GuardExpr2, ..., GuardExprN` is true if all the guard
% expressions `GuardExpr1`, `GuardExpr2`, ..., `GuardExprN` evaluate to `true`.

is_dog(A) when is_atom(A), A =:= dog -> true;

% A guard sequence is either a single guard or a series of guards, separated
% by semicolons (`;`). The guard sequence `G1; G2; ...; Gn` is true if at
% least one of the guards `G1`, `G2`, ..., `Gn` evaluates to `true`.
